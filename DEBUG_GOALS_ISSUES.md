# üîç Debug Guide: Goals Issues

## üö® **Issues You Reported to Fix:**

1. **"Why do we have financial goals and goals management as separate sections?"**
2. **"Why can't we edit the individual sections of the goals, only delete?"**  
3. **"When I click new goal, I am still seeing browser generated fields"**

## üß™ **Step-by-Step Debugging:**

### **Step 1: Clear Browser Cache**
**IMPORTANT:** Hard refresh to clear cache:
- **Chrome/Edge:** `Ctrl + Shift + R` or `Ctrl + F5`
- **Firefox:** `Ctrl + Shift + R`
- **Or:** Open DevTools (F12) ‚Üí Right-click refresh button ‚Üí "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

### **Step 2: Fresh Login Test**
1. Go to `http://localhost:3000`
2. Login: `jamal@example.com` / `jamal123`
3. Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/app/profile`
4. **Wait 5 seconds** for page to fully load

### **Step 3: Count Goal Sections**
Look for section headings:
- ‚úÖ **Should see:** "Goals Management" (only one section)
- ‚ùå **Should NOT see:** "Financial Goals" section
- ‚ùå **Should NOT see:** Any duplicate goals sections

**If you still see two sections:**
- Take a screenshot
- Check browser DevTools Console (F12) for JavaScript errors

### **Step 4: Test Goal Creation (No Browser Prompts)**
1. Find the **"Add New Goal"** button (green button)
2. Click it
3. **Expected:** Beautiful modal window opens with form fields
4. **NOT Expected:** Browser prompt() dialog boxes

**If you see browser prompts:**
- Check DevTools Console for errors
- Try refreshing page and retry
- The modal might not be loading due to JavaScript error

### **Step 5: Test Goal Editing**
1. If you have existing goals, look for **"Edit"** button on each goal
2. If no goals exist, create one first using the modal
3. Click **"Edit"** button on any goal
4. **Expected:** Modal opens with pre-filled data
5. Change values and click "Update Goal"
