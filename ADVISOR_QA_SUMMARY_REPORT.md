# Advisor Onboarding QA Analysis - Executive Summary

## Current Status: COMPONENTS READY, INTEGRATION REQUIRED

### Key Findings

#### ✅ **Strengths Identified**
1. **Complete Component Suite**: All 3 advisor onboarding components exist and are well-built
2. **Solid Foundation**: Professional UI design, proper form validation, clear user flow
3. **Persona Definition**: Emily Chen advisor persona clearly defined with test credentials
4. **Database Schema**: Backend supports advisor-specific fields (firm_name, license_number, etc.)

#### ❌ **Critical Gaps Requiring Immediate Attention**
1. **Missing Route Integration**: Advisor onboarding routes not integrated in App.js
2. **Dashboard Limitations**: Generic dashboard lacks advisor-specific features
3. **API Integration Uncertainty**: Need to verify advisor field persistence in backend
4. **Persona Alignment**: Emily Chen → Emily Njeri name update needed for PRD compliance

## Advisor Persona Analysis

### Primary Persona: Emily Chen (Fee-only CFP)
**Current Test Account**: `emily@advisor.com` / `emily123`

**PRD Requirements**:
- **Target Name**: Emily Njeri (current: Chen)
- **Specialization**: Fee-only CFP® for HNW clients
- **Key Needs**: Monte Carlo simulations, tax-efficient planning, audit trail
- **Professional Standards**: Fiduciary compliance, professional-grade interface

**Current Implementation Gap**:
- Components support her workflow but aren't integrated into main application routing
- Dashboard needs advisor-specific features for professional use

### Secondary Persona: Daniel Mwangi (Bank-affiliated)
**Status**: Defined in PRD but no test account created yet
- **Role**: Bank-affiliated planner for mass-affluent
- **Needs**: Rapid KYC, product recommendations, compliance memos
- **Implementation**: Requires test account creation and validation

## Integration Requirements - Priority Fixes

### 1. IMMEDIATE (1-2 hours): Route Integration
**Problem**: Advisor onboarding components exist but aren't accessible via routing

**Solution Required in App.js**:
```javascript
// Add to App.js routes:
<Route path="/onboarding/advisor/*" element={
  <OnboardingProvider>
    <Routes>
      <Route path="professional-details" element={<AdvisorProfessionalDetails />} />
      <Route path="service-model" element={<AdvisorServiceModel />} />
      <Route path="complete" element={<AdvisorOnboardingComplete />} />
    </Routes>
  </OnboardingProvider>
} />
```

**Validation**: Test complete flow from registration → onboarding → dashboard

### 2. SHORT-TERM (1-2 days): Dashboard Enhancement
**Problem**: Generic dashboard not suitable for professional advisor use

**Requirements for Emily Chen persona**:
- Client-focused metrics instead of personal finance tools
- Professional language and presentation
- Features supporting fiduciary practice
- Mobile/tablet compatibility for client meetings

### 3. MEDIUM-TERM (1 week): API Integration Validation
**Problem**: Uncertain if advisor-specific fields properly persist via API

**Validation Needed**:
- POST `/auth/register` with role: "advisor" 
- PUT `/auth/profile` saves firm_name, license_number, professional_email
- GET `/auth/profile` returns complete advisor profile
- Database properly stores and retrieves advisor fields
