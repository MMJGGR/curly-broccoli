# Comprehensive QA Testing Guide: Advisor Onboarding Flow

## Executive Summary

This guide provides comprehensive QA testing guidance for validating the advisor onboarding flow against defined advisor personas and PRD requirements. Based on code analysis, the advisor onboarding components exist but require integration and thorough testing validation.

## 1. Advisor Persona Analysis

### 1.1 Primary Advisor Persona: Emily Chen
**Current Test Account**: `emily@advisor.com` / `emily123`

**PRD Target Specifications**:
- **Name**: Emily Njeri (target: should be updated from Chen → Njeri)

### 1.2 Secondary Advisor Persona: Daniel Mwangi
**Defined but not yet implemented in test data**
- **Role**: Bank-affiliated planner for mass-affluent clients
- **Key Needs**: Rapid KYC, product recommendations, compliance memos
- **Client Focus**: Mass-affluent market with standardized products

## 2. Current Advisor Onboarding Flow Analysis

### 2.1 Existing Components
✅ **AdvisorProfessionalDetails.js** - Step 1 of 3
- Collects: firstName, lastName, firmName, licenseNumber, professionalEmail, phone
- Validation: Required fields validation implemented
- Storage: Uses localStorage temporarily

describe('Advisor Registration & Onboarding', () => {
  it('should complete Emily Chen advisor registration', () => {
    // Implementation based on existing persona patterns
  });
