## üéØ Strategic Positioning & Competitive Advantage

### **Why Budget is Critical for Market Leadership**

**Current Market Gaps:**
- **Mint**: Basic budget tracking, limited goal integration
- **YNAB**: Strong budgeting but weak investment/retirement planning integration

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Decision: Budget Placement Strategy

### **RECOMMENDED APPROACH: Enhanced Cashflows Tab**

**Decision**: Integrate Budget as primary feature within existing Cashflows tab
**Rationale**: 
- Cashflows naturally encompasses both actual spending (transactions) and planned spending (budget)
- Maintains clean 5-tab navigation without overcrowding
- Leverages existing expense categorization infrastructure
- Creates powerful Budget vs Actual analysis capabilities

### **Tab Restructure:**
```
Cashflows Tab ‚Üí "Budget & Cashflows"
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Budget Planning (primary view)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Transaction Tracking  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Budget vs Actual Analysis
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Spending Insights & Projections
```
