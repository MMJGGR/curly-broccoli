# 🎉 Improved Profile UI - Testing Guide

## 🚀 **What We Fixed:**

### ✅ **Issue 1: Duplicate Goals Sections**
**BEFORE:** Had both "Financial Goals" and "Goals Management" sections (confusing!)
**AFTER:** Single "Goals Management" section with comprehensive functionality

### ✅ **Issue 2: Browser Prompts**
**BEFORE:** Used ugly `prompt()` dialogs for goal creation
**AFTER:** Beautiful modal with form validation and progress preview

### ✅ **Issue 3: Wireframe Placeholders**
**BEFORE:** Buttons showed "This is a wireframe action" 
**AFTER:** Proper functional buttons with real navigation

### **Step 1: Login & Navigate**
1. Go to `http://localhost:3000`
2. Login: `jamal@example.com` / `jamal123`
3. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/app/profile`

### **Step 2: Test New Goals Management Section**

#### ✅ **Test Beautiful Goal Creation Modal:**

2. **Modal should open** (NOT browser prompt!)
3. **Fill out the form:**
   - Goal Name: `Emergency Fund`
   - Target Amount: `150000`
   - Current Amount: `37500`
   - Target Date: `2025-12-31`
4. **Watch progress preview update** as you type (25.0%)
5. Click **"Create Goal"** 
6. **Modal closes** and goal appears with progress bar

#### ✅ **Test Goal Editing:**
1. Click **"Edit"** button on any goal
2. Modal opens with **existing data pre-filled**
3. Change values and click **"Update Goal"**
4. Changes should appear immediately

### **Step 3: Test Improved Account Settings**

#### ✅ **No More Wireframe Messages:**
- Scroll to **"Account Settings"** section
- Should see proper toggle buttons:
  - **"Enabled ✓"** for notifications
  - **"High Security ✓"** for privacy  
  - **"Manage Accounts →"** for linked accounts
- **NO "wireframe action" messages anywhere!**

#### ✅ **Test Navigation:**
- Click **"Manage Accounts →"** → should navigate to `/app/accounts`
- Click **"Retake Risk Assessment"** → should navigate to risk questionnaire
- Click **"Change Password"** → shows proper message (not wireframe)

### **Step 4: Test Enhanced UX**

#### ✅ **Form Validation:**
- Open goal modal
- **"Create Goal" button disabled** until all required fields filled
- Progress preview updates **in real-time** as you type

#### ✅ **Visual Polish:**

## 🚨 **If Something Doesn't Work:**

1. **Modal doesn't open?** → Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. **Old sections still showing?** → Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)
3. **Wireframe messages still appear?** → Check specific button clicked
4. **Navigation doesn't work?** → Verify routing is set up correctly
